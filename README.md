# ABSTRACT
The purpose of this strategy is to screen out dark horse funds in the whole market, that is, funds with low institutional attention. The dark horse factor, momentum factor and industry dispersion factor were constructed. The comprehensive factor is constructed by IC mean weighting. Comparison with the Biased Hybrid Fund Index shows that the strategy has significant overweights in the non-huddling market.
